# Summary 5/23


The purpose is and was to find my entry point into the world of IT.
Through countless hours of research, youtube, and plain ol' trial and error,
i eventually stumbled upon homelabs and i was hooked. I learned that
building out my own infrastructure and deploying my own services 
was the optimal way for me to learn because of my very hands on nature.

Another motivation for me to pursue this route of learning was simply price.
Since technology is my preferred  cup of tea, i have always kept older PCs and 
parts when i upgraded so i already had the appropriate hardware, therefore 
eliminating any need to buy expensive equipment upfront. To be fair, i did buy
the Optiplex from Fb marketplace in early 2023 for around $60(US).
