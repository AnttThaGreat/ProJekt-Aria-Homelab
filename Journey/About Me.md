# About Me

My name is Antonio this is my homelab journey.
Being born in 1989, i have always felt rather out of place in public or around my peers.
I think it was the combination of being born too late to have lived the  "80's baby" life and born too early to actually be a "90's kid". Either way the one thing that has always been available to me, no matter when i was born was computers.

I dont know the exact specifications of the first computer i ever used, but i remember it for 3 reasons. One, the desk my dad had a glass section that you could see thru to the screen being housed underneath. Two, when you booted the computer, in order to access the window manager and get to the desktop and games, you had to type "windows"  on the 
command line that popped up. Lastly, minesweeper was the first game i ever played on a computer. i remember spending house as a kid trying to guess all the blocks with out bombs. Good times.

The Internet is another technology that i have grown to take for granted. Not in the "woke politics" or the "record everything for the internet way" No, i mean the fact that i have literally grown with the internet since its toddler years. Ive watched pioneer ISPs like  AOL and Compuserve give way to massive all in one multi service providers like Verizon and Charter. The original search engine(at least to me), Askjeeves.com opened the door for the data hungry, money pinching, multi billion dollar corporations we love today. 

Along with the growth of the internet grew my interest in the way it worked. Something about having access to whatever information i wanted, whenever i wanted sparked a fire inside of me. It was enough that i could get any information i wanted, i needed to know
how it worked. How did that particular "dial up noise" get all the websites back to me.
What are cookies and why did they always get me caught up with my parents for looking at
18+ stuff. I had to know.

Somewhere in early 2000 i took a few computer science courses at the community college,
i did the typical hardware/software class, i even took a networking specific class. I left those classes unfulfilled and starving for knowledge and life happened so i had to put formal education on the back burner. I had my first child in 2011 so getting a real job became a thing, then i had a second in 2013. This also when i got my first laptop. It was Dell XPS 13 with the multimedia buttons along the front. Small laptop, but it became my obsession. i used it for torrents, limewire, binge watching downloaded movies and shows, rooting and jailbreaking phones, you name it. If you needed to get it done on a computer i could do it. 

Needless to say ive had multiple laptops over years because everytime windows upgrades the old computers stop working. i dont know it could just be me. Somewhere in 2018 i discovered linux as a way to bring life to old machines. I installed  Ubuntu 20.10 on an old laptop and it worked like a charm. At this point i have two machines and im experimenting with linux on one. Distro hopping and command line. Straight nerd shit. From there on i fell down the linux rabbit hole and i havent hit the bottom (pause).

Fast forward to 2023, i found my calling, i found what the career path i want to dedicate my life to, hence the time spent documenting everything. I dont know for certain specifally which IT path i will take, but i do know that any direction this proffesion leads me, that this project will be the cornerstone of it all. 

Thank you self for taking on this mission, the mission to learn, have fun, and ultimately put you and your family in a position of financial success.
